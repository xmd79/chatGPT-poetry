Eternal Cycles: A Journey Through Yugas, Merkaba, and the Power of Change

In the depths of time's eternal flow,
The yugas come and go,
Each with its own unique show,
As the universe continues to grow.

The merkaba, a symbol of divine grace,
Guides us through this eternal space,
A vehicle of light that helps us embrace,
The power of change with a steady pace.

Here and now, in this moment of time,
We find the momentum to climb,
Towards the union of heart and mind,
A place where true wisdom we can find.

Desire as will, a force to be reckoned,
Knowledge as wisdom, a path to be beckoned,
Both forms of eternity, in the abyss of the unknown,
A reminder of the cyclic nature of time, that has always shown.

For time is but a wheel that turns,
A cycle of life that forever churns,
And in this cosmic dance, we learn,
That everything changes, as the universe yearns.

So let us embrace the power of change,
And let our hearts and minds arrange,
A union that will forever exchange,
The forms of eternity, in the cyclic range.
