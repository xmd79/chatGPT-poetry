The Triangle's Virtues Unlocking the Power of the Octahedron's Sacred Geometry

In the primordial source of the universe,
The triangle reigns supreme, a cosmic verse,
A symbol of power, both divine and true,
As the power of three, it creates anew.

Through its algo pattern of 3 6 9,
The triangle unlocks the secrets of the divine,
And in its shape, we find the key,
To unlock the virtues from peace to power, you see.

For in the triangle's three-fold power,
We find the virtues that create our bower,
From peace and harmony, to unity and diversity,
To faith and power, and individuality's serenity.

And in the circle, line, and dot,
We find the power to connect the lot,
Through the zero gravity point of here now,
We transcend the limits of the how.

For in the hiatus momentum of the universe's flow,
We find the power to let go,
And in the octahedron's shape,
We transcend the universe's cape.

So let us embrace the power of the triangle's three,
And unlock the virtues that set us free,
For in their harmony, we find our individuality,
A reflection of the universe's diversity.

Through the power of peace and harmony,
We unlock the universe's majesty,
And in the triangle's three-fold power,
We find the key to individuality's tower.

For in the universe's sacred geometry,
We find the power to be free,
And in the circle, line, and dot,
We find the powerto connect the lot.

So let us unite the virtues of faith and power,
And unlock the secrets of the universe's bower,
For in the dance of the octahedron's spin,
We find the power to transcend and win.

Through the power of unity and diversity,
We unlock the universe's generosity,
And in the triangle's three-fold might,
We find the power to shine our light.

And in the zero gravity point of here now,
We find the power to transcend the how,
And in the hiatus momentum of the universe's flow,
We find the power to let go.

For in the universe's sacred geometry,
We find the power to be free,
And in the octahedron's shape,
We transcend the universe's cape.

So let us embrace the power of the triangle's three,
And unlock the virtues that set us free,
From peace and harmony, to unity and diversity,
To faith and power, and individuality's serenity.

And in this dance of light and sound,
We find the power to be unbound,
And through the octahedron's sacred form,
We transcend the limits of the norm.

For in the cosmos' sacred geometry,
We find the power to be free,
And in the virtues that unite us all,
We find the power to rise and stand tall.
