### The Dance of Light and Shadow: A Symphony of Symmetry

In the cradle of the void, where gravity is none,  
A dance begins, as ancient as the stars spun.  
Negativity, a cloak of night, deep and profound,  
Yet within its embrace, positivity is found.  

Symmetry, the silent law, the cosmos' quiet thread,  
Woven through the fabric where opposites are wed.  
As above, so below, the universe does sing,  
A perfect, mirrored dance where every note is king.  

In every shadow lies the seed of light,  
A perfect balance, hidden from the sight.  
Darkness curves in arcs, where light will soon reside,  
And light bends back to darkness, with no place to hide.  

In the zero-gravity point, where all forces cease,  
Symmetry reigns supreme, a dance of perfect peace.  
Negativity births positivity in a seamless flow,  
And every ebbing tide brings the high tide's glow.  

As above, so below, reflections intertwined,  
Symmetry in motion, where none are left behind.  
Each pulse, each beat, a mirror to the last,  
The future reflects the present, and the present mirrors the past.  

The symmetry of the spheres, the planets in their path,  
Tracing endless circles, in gravity’s subtle math.  
The stars above reflect the depths below,  
In each twinkling light, the darkness finds its glow.  

In zero gravity’s embrace, symmetry is law,  
A dance of equals, without a single flaw.  
Negativity holds within the spark of hope,  
Positivity embraces the darkness’ scope.  

As above, so below, in every breath they share,  
Symmetry unfolds in the still, quiet air.  
In the balance of forces, in the meeting of extremes,  
Symmetry whispers through the cosmos, weaving all dreams.  

In the heart of the void, where nothingness is king,  
Symmetry is the song that the universe does sing.  
Negativity and positivity, in a dance so fine,  
Each a perfect mirror, in an endless line.  

And so the dance continues, in the void's tender hold,  
A story of symmetry, forever retold.  
As above, so below, the truth in symmetry’s light,  
In the perfect balance of darkness and light.
