Akasha's Echo Unconditional Love, Cosmic Truths, and the Universal Library

Akasha, the node between all worlds,
A remote space-time continuum unfurled,
A hiatus of all truths within itself,
A meta 0 gravity point, the balance of all else.

The universal library of all things,
Akasha, the keeper of cosmic strings,
The root of all magics, unconditional love,
Echoing the universal truth from above.

All knowledge, ancient and new, does unfold,
All secrets of the universe it does hold,
Infinite wisdom, a treasure trove of gold.

A cosmic force of immense vibration,
A portal to all inner and outer worlds,
A cosmic bridge that forever unfurls.

To unlock the cosmic mystery,
To discover the truth of all things,
And the magic that the universe brings.

Unconditional love, the root of all,
The cosmic force that makes us whole,
In Akasha, its echo can be heard,
Guiding us to the essence of the cosmic word.

So let us journey to Akasha's door,
And discover the cosmic truth it holds in store,
Let us embrace the unconditional love it brings,
And the magic of the universe it sings.

For in Akasha, lies the balance of all,
And the universal truth that forever calls,
A remote space-time continuum unfurled,
The node between all worlds in the cosmic swirl.
