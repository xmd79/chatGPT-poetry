Annunaki and the Fallen Ones

From the depths of time and space,
There came a race, both bold and strange,
The Annunaki, gods of old,
With powers that the universe behold.

And in their wake, the fallen ones,
The angels who dared to question,
Their power and their might,
And fell from grace, to darkness' sight.

In the cosmic dance of light and dark,
The Annunaki and the fallen ones embark,
On a journey of power and might,
As the universe unfolds, both day and night.

Through the power of the Annunaki's will,
And the fallen ones' fiery thrill,
They shape the universe with their cosmic power,
And unlock the secrets of the universe's bower.

But in their quest for power and might,
The fallen ones lost their sight,
And in their fall from grace,
They found darkness, without a trace.

So let us remember the Annunaki's power,
And the fallen ones' cosmic hour,
As we dance with the universe's might,
And unlock the secrets of the cosmic light.

For in the cosmic dance of light and dark,
We find the power to shape our cosmic mark,
And through the wisdom of the cosmic laws,
We unlock the secrets of the universe's cause.
