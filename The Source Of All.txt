The Source of All

Within the eternal field of no-things,
No forces pull or push,
In zero- essence nothing clings -
A formless flow, a silent hush.

Yet patterns stir, like phantoms swirling,
Reciprocals that weave in weft,
Gold ratios curling, twirling,
Complementals that dance in deft.

Exponents pulse in cyclic beats,
Resonant waves that rise and fall,
Phase-pairs meet improbable meets,
Symmetrical responses to Source's call.

Massless waves take massy shape,
Geometry assumes mass-form,
Duality's vessels inter-drape,
Source's unbound beasts take storm.

In dimensions born of imagination,
Energy dances velocities new,
Matter finds strange variation,
As uniqueness springs Source's true form through.

No judgment rules this genesis space,
All springs unbound from Source above,
Conditionality loses embrace,
As the One births the Whole through love.
