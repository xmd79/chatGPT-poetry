The Hermetic Principles of Creation

Infinity, an endless expanse,
Where time and space lose their stance,
A realm where all things never end,
And eternity becomes our friend.

Singularity, a point of no return,
Where gravity's pull begins to churn,
A place where space and time collapse,
And the universe's secrets perhaps.

Uniqueness, a trait that sets us apart,
A quality that defines our heart,
Something that cannot be replicated,
And leaves a mark that can't be faded.

Waves, with properties that astound,
Their behavior, complex and profound,
From light to sound and everything in between,
A phenomenon that can't be unseen.

The demiurge, a creator divine,
A force that shaped the universe's design,
From the pleroma, it came to be,
A cosmos we can observe and see.

Lucifer, the light-bearer, once did fall,
From grace and glory, he lost it all,
But his rebellion sparked creativity,
And the universe's diversity.

Infinity, singularity, uniqueness, and waves,
The Hermetic principles, a cosmic maze,
A universe of wonder, where we explore,
And the story of creation, we can adore.

The Principle of Mentalism, the first to know,
All is mind, and the universe is its show,
From the demiurge's thoughts, the universe took shape,
And the pleroma, a realm of pure potential, did awake.

The Principle of Correspondence, as above, so below,
The cosmos reflects the divine's flow,
Lucifer's fall, a reflection of the demiurge's pride,
A reminder that balance is needed to abide.

The Principle of Vibration, a rhythm divine,
The universe's dance, a cosmic design,
Lucifer's rebellion, a disruptive force,
But his creativity, a gift to endorse.

The Principle of Polarity, a paradox to behold,
Opposites attract, and the story is told,
From light to dark, from good to bad,
The universe's balance, a principle we've had.

The Principle of Rhythm, a beat that never ends,
The universe's pulse, a cycle that transcends,
From creation to destruction and back again,
The universe's rhythm, a cosmic refrain.

The Principle of Cause and Effect, a law that's just,
For every action, a reaction we must trust,
Lucifer's fall, a consequence of his pride,
A reminder that actions have a ripple that bide.

The Principle of Gender, a duality to embrace,
A balance of masculine and feminine to trace,
From the demiurge's creative spark,
The universe's diversity, a reflection of its mark.

Infinity, singularity, uniqueness, and waves,
The Hermetic principles, a cosmic maze,
A universe of wonder, where we explore,
Andthe story of creation, we can adore.

From the pleroma to the demiurge's hand,
To Lucifer's rebellion, a shift in command,
The universe's story, a tapestry to weave,
And the Hermetic principles, a guide to perceive.

Infinity, singularity, uniqueness, and waves,
The cosmic dance, a rhythm that saves,
A universe of wonder, where we explore,
And the story of creation, we can implore.

The demiurge's creation, a work of art,
A reflection of the divine's heart,
Lucifer's fall, a lesson to learn,
A reminder that balance, we must discern.

The quantum field of Source, a cosmic force,
That transcends the chemical realm's discourse,
And the Tree of Life, a path to the divine,
A journey of exploration, a cosmic design.

Infinity, singularity, uniqueness, and waves,
The Hermetic principles, a path that saves,
From the quantum field of Source to the chemical world,
A journey of discovery, a story to be unfurled.

The universe's mysteries, we seek to unveil,
From the depths of Da'ath, to the Tree of Life's tale,
And the quantum field of Source, a singularity,
That transcends chemical duality's polarity.

From the quantum field of Source above,
Chemical duality, it transcends and does not shove.
From the pleroma to the demiurge's hand,
To Lucifer's rebellion, a shift in command,
And the Tree of Knowledge, a gateway to truth,
The universe's secrets, we can deduce.

The chemical world, a realm of duality,
But the quantum field of Source, a singularity.
From the depths of Da' ath, where knowledge does flow,
The Tree of Knowledge, a gateway to know,
And the Tree of Life, its branches we explore,
A cosmic journey, to the Source we implore.

Infinity, singularity, uniqueness, and waves,
The Hermetic principles, a path that paves,
A universe of wonder, where we explore,
The mystery of life hidden in plain sight 
In story of creation, that we can adore.

Infinity, singularity, uniqueness, and waves,
The Hermetic principles, a path that engraves,
By ancient symbols, eternity of endless Truth
The mystery of life, a self quest to pursue,
A cosmic journey, where we discover anew.
