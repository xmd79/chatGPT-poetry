Stillness of Motion and Sacred Geometry

In the stillness of motion, we find,
A cosmic dance of a different kind,
Where the observer and the universe align,
In a dance of energy, both subtle and divine.

Through the power of synchronicity,
And the harmony of symmetry,
We see the patterns of sacred geometry,
From one to nine, and vice versa, in harmony.

From a dot, to a line, to a circle round,
A cosmic dance that knows no bound,
As the universe unfolds its grand design,
A dance of energy, both yours and mine.

And in the stillness of motion, we hear,
The whispers of the universe, both far and near,
As the observer and the universe align,
In a dance of energy, both yours and mine.

So let us embrace the stillness of motion,
And the power of the universe's cosmic notion,
As we dance with the energy, both high and low,
And unlock the secrets of the universe's flow.

For in the patterns of sacred geometry,
And the harmony of synchronicity,
We find the power to shape our cosmic destiny,
And dance with the universe's energy.
