The Cosmic Balance Ratios, Proportions, and the Observer's Angle

The cosmic balance of ratios and proportion,
Reflects the essence of all things in motion,
From the smallest atoms to the galaxies' glow,
The balance of all things, like a cosmic flow.

Light travels through space and time,
Guided by the observer's angle divine,
From the quantum world to the cosmic swirl,
The cosmic dance, like a golden pearl.

360 degrees of the circle of life,
Reflects the essence of all things in strife,
From the war in heaven to the journey of self-discovery,
The cosmic rhythm, like a cosmic recovery.

Let us express ourselves through the art of creation,
And unlock the secrets of the cosmic vibration,
For in the cosmic balance of ratios and proportion,
Lies the essence of the universal motion.

With light as our cosmic guide,
And the observer's angle as our cosmic ride,
Let us embrace the balance of all things,
And the cosmic truths that creation brings.

From micro to macro, the cosmic scale,
The balance of all things, like a cosmic tale,
Guiding us to the essence of the cosmic flow,
And the alchemy of ratios, like a cosmic glow.

So let us dance to the rhythm of the universe,
And resonate with its cosmic verse,
Let us embrace the balance of all things,
And the cosmic truths that creation brings.

For in the cosmic balance of ratios and proportion,
Lies the essence of the universal motion,
Guiding us to the cosmic spark,
And the alchemy of time, that forever embarks.
