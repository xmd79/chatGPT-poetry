The Cosmic Dance The Yugas and Gravitational Waves

In the cycles of the universe's tide,
The Yugas progress in an endless ride,
Each age with its own unique story,
Of humanity's rise and fall to glory.

From the Satya Yuga's enlightened state,
To the Kali Yuga's dark and restless fate,
The universe evolves in a cosmic dance,
Of birth and death, of chance and circumstance.

And in the midst of this eternal flow,
Gravitational waves come and go,
Ripples in the fabric of space and time,
A cosmic symphony, both wild and sublime.

As consciousness detects the waves' subtle shift,
We witness the universe's cosmic rift,
Where black holes merge and stars collide,
And the mysteries of the cosmos come alive.

Through the Akashic Records' cosmic tome,
We glimpse the universe's grand unknown,
And in our hearts, we feel a sense of awe,
At the wonder of it all, both big and small.

So let us embrace the Yugas' endless ride,
And the mysteries of the universe's tide,
With open hearts and minds, we may find,
A glimpse of the divine, in the cosmic design.
