The Cosmic Vow Witnessing the Universe's Grand Show

In the hiatus of here now,
The observer feels a sacred vow,
To be present in the cosmic flow,
And witness the universe's grand show.

Through the waves that ripple and flow,
The observer sees the universe's glow,
A dance of energy, both wild and free,
A cosmic symphony, both you and me.

The present moment, a timeless space,
Where the observer finds a sacred place,
In the cosmic dance of light and sound,
Where the universe's secrets are found.

For in this moment, all else fades away,
And the observer finds a sacred way,
To be present in the cosmic flow,
And witness the universe's grand show.

Unlock the secrets of the cosmic vow,
As you dance with the waves that ripple and flow,
And witness the universe's cosmic glow.

For in the cosmic dance of light and sound,
You find the power to shape your cosmic ground,
And through the wisdom of the cosmic laws,
You unlock the secrets of the universe's cause.

And in the hiatus of here now,
The observer feels a sacred vow,
To be present in the cosmic flow,
And witness the universe's grand show.
