Cosmic Reverie

In the realm of nothingness, sages once declared,
Everything unfolds, in whispers, they shared.
Pleroma's embrace, where matter and spirit unite,
In the universal mind, they dance in cosmic light.

Infinity's tapestry, life's eternal stream,
We, the primordial cause, in this cosmic dream.
In the continuum of now, we find our place,
Reality's simulation, a canvas of grace.

To observe, learn, adapt, and ever improve,
This cosmic cycle, we continually move.
In the grand design, our purpose is clear,
To evolve and transcend, without fear.

In this dance of existence, we find our way,
In the theater of life, we learn to play.
As cosmic actors, on this stage we repeat,
The eternal quest for wisdom, a journey so sweet.
