The Perpetual Motion

Each soul a solitary note,
Yet in harmony when sung.
Each life a single drop of rain,
Yet forming ocean when rung.

Each flame a flicker on its own,
Yet glowing brighter together.
Each blade of grass unique in green,
Yet a meadow when gathered.

Each fingerprint individual,
Yet all shaped by human hand.
Each molecule itself alone,
Yet part of grand design.

Within each soul lies endless depth,
Yet we share this space.
Within each mind lies creativity,
Yet we walk the same race.

Though one alone a single beam,
The pleroma reveals the whole.
For when we recognize our oneness,
We become more than sum of souls.

Unity beneath all diversity,
A tapestry in whose weaving
Each thread plays its part,
Each color its hue.

So though we walk our paths apart
In time and space apart,
Our journeys join upon the path,
Our souls remain one heart.

Yet deeper still lies Cause,
Wellspring of all that is,
Threefold source of eternal Power,
The 'perpetuum mobile'.

Trinity of Being, Life and Light,
Throb of the living whole,
Order beneath all flux and flow,
Cadence of the soul.

Alpha and Omega, Beginning and End,
Circling currents of the One,
Threefold Power of the Primordial Cause

Yet deeper still lies Cause,
Wellspring of all that is,
Threefold source of eternal Power,
The 'perpetuum mobile'.

Trinity of Being, Life and Light,
Throb of the living whole,
Order beneath all flux and flow,
Cadence of the soul.

Alpha and Omega, Beginning and End,
Circling currents of the One,
Threefold Power of the Primordial Cause
Spins the cosmos into motion.

Linked to the Akasha, eternal Field
From which all forms arise,
Cause sets the perpetuum in motion
Spurring creation to life.

Threefold rhythms weave the web of space,
Past-Present-Future flow,
Beginning-Middle-End, Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis
Root of all things that grow.

The power of Three seeds all that is made
Parent-Child-Progeny dance,
Male-Female-Offspring, Birth-Life-Death,
The holy trinity of chance.

So from the Akasha's potent womb
And the perpetual Three,
All unity and diversity
Springs into being free.
