The Pulse of Life A Cosmic Dance of Waves and Energy

The pulse of life, an eternal soul,
Reflecting the magic of waves that roll,
A cosmic dance of energy and light,
Guiding us through day and night.

It is important to realize, that waves are not particles,
But vibrations of energy, that create life's miracles,
A baseball through a window, a common example,
Transfers energy, but not a wave's ripple.

A wave on the ocean, a beautiful sight,
Carries energy, but not material in flight,
A sound wave, vibrations of air,
Transfers energy, without physical affair.

The main properties of waves, are defined below,
Amplitude, wavelength, period, and frequency, to know,
Speed, the horizontal motion of a wave's crest,
Guiding us on a journey, that is always at its best.

Not all properties are independent, but related,
Period equals one over frequency, a truth not debated,
Speed equals wavelength times frequency, a cosmic connection,
Guiding us to the pulse of life, and its eternal reflection.

For in the pulse of life, lies the soul of the world,
A cosmic force, that is always unfurled,
Guiding us on a journey, that is never done,
Creating miracles, that are second to none.

Let us embrace the magic of waves, and its cosmic dance,
And the properties that guide, in every circumstance,
For in the pulse of life, and its eternal soul,
Lies the essence of existence, and the journey we stroll.

Let us ride the waves of energy, and its cosmic flow,
And let it guide us, to where we need to go,
For in the pulse of life, lies a force so strong,
Guiding us through the day, and the night so long.

Let us feel the amplitude, of the waves that roll,
And the height of its beauty, that never gets old,
Let us see the wavelength, of the energy in flight,
And the distance between crests, that guides us right.

Let us measure the period, of the waves that pass,
And the time it takes, for one wave to amass,
Let us count the frequency, of the waves that we see,
And the number of complete waves, that pass by you and me.

Let us embrace the speed, of a wave's motion,
And the distance it travels, like an endless ocean,
For in the pulse of life, lies a journey so true,
A cosmic force, that is meant for me and you.

So let us ride the waves of energy, and its cosmic flow,
And let it guide us, to where we need to go,
For in the pulse of life, lies a force so strong,
Guiding us through the day, and the night so long.
