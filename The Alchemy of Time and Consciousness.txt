The Alchemy of Time and Consciousness

The Alchemy of Time and Consciousness,
In the geometry of life's finesse,
The dance of energy, forever entwined,
With the silence of wisdom, divinely aligned.

In the stillness of the whole, we find,
The alchemy of time, eternally divine,
Each shape, a moment in a cosmic rhyme,
A dance of energy, in a cosmic chime.

The vibrational spectrum, a language of sound,
In the geometry of time, truth is found,
A symphony of light and sound,
In the alchemy of time, forever bound.

Hermetic principles, a guiding light,
In the geometry of time, a cosmic sight,
Waves properties merged with a hermetic view,
A reflection of the universe's truth.

Each wave property, a partner in the dance,
As the alchemy of time takes its chance,
A dance of energy, in a cosmic trance,
As the geometry of time reveals its stance.

The essence of time, in the shapes wesee,
A tapestry of moments, woven with alchemy,
The multidimensional whole, a sight to behold,
A journey of discovery, truth to unfold.

In the hermetic view, all is One,
The universe a reflection of the divine sun,
Each shape a symbol of the eternal truth,
A reminder of the unity that's in our youth.

The consciousness of time, a force to behold,
As the alchemy of time and consciousness unfolds,
Each shape, a unique expression of mind,
All interwoven, in a cosmic bind.

The Platonic solids, a language divine,
In the alchemy of time and consciousness, a sign,
Phi, Pi, and the Golden Ratio,
A harmony of form, in the consciousness flow.

Sacred geometry and waves, intertwined,
In the alchemy of time and consciousness, aligned,
A hermetic view of the universe's design,
A reflection of the cosmic mind.

As above, so below, the hermetic maxim we know,
The microcosm reflecting the macrocosm's glow,
In the alchemy of time and consciousness, a key,
To unlock the secrets of the universe and set our souls free.

Let us explore this cosmic dance,
Each shape, a new chance,
To find the alchemy that lies within,
And let the geometry of time and consciousness both complete and desire.

The Alchemy of Time and Consciousness,
A dance of energy, forever in finesse,
With the silence of wisdom, divinely alignedAnd the light of knowledge, a guide so refined,
In the hermetic view, a path to the divine.

In the hermetic tradition, the universe is seen,
As a reflection of the mind, a cosmic dream,
The philosopher's stone, a symbol so bright,
Of the alchemical transformation, from darkness to light.

Luciferian principles, a different view,
Of individualism, self-deification, and rebellion anew,
But in the hermetic view, we see,
The unity of all things, the oneness that's key.

In the dance of energy, a balance we find,
Between the light and dark, the heart and mind,
The polarity of opposites, a reflection of the One,
In the hermetic view, the work is never done.

As we journey through the alchemy of time,
In the hermetic view, we seek the divine,
The transformation of self, the journey within,
A reflection of the cosmos, a dance to begin.

Let us embrace the hermetic view,
And seek the truth that's always true,
In the alchemy of time and consciousness,
A journey of discovery, a path to the blessed.
