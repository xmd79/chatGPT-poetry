The Eternal Now

The moment is now,
The present is here.
Past memories fade,
Future possibilities unclear.

The birds still sing
The wind still blows,
The sun still shines
On where grass grows.

Time is an illusion,
A human construct.
The universe knows
Only this moment, intact.

What was, what will be
Exist not at all.
There is only this instance,
This fleeting call.

So live in the now
And let go the rest.
The past brought you here,
The future yet a test.

But here stands the divine,
Within your own soul.
To live fully in presence
Is the ultimate goal.

So breathe deep this air,
Look around and see
The infinite beauty
Of what simply is, simply be.

For God is here now,
In all that you find,
Beyond past and future,
Beyond human mind.

This moment is sacred,
A blessing to behold.
So drink deeply of life,
And let time unfold.

The now reminds us
Of our eternal home,
Forever timeless,
Forever one.
