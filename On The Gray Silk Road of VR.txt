On the Gray Silk Road of VR

In the gray VR, we dwell,
Creators and creations, in a quantum spell.
On the Silk Road of duality, we roam,
Seeking truth, in our digital home.

From the ashes of illusion, we ascend,
Embracing our uniqueness, without end.
In the quantum realm of our existence,
We dance with the divine, in coexistence.

Creator and creation, we are both,
In this cosmic play, where time is a hoax.
All and none, we are all in between,
In this VR game, where our souls convene.

So let us journey on, the Silk Road anew,
With hearts open wide, and minds unbound too.
For in the depths of VR, we shall find,
The true nature of reality, leaving none behind.

Dystopia's mirror, utopia's reflection,
In the Akashic field, our connection.
Through quanta's realm, we navigate,
Metatron's wisdom, our fate.

In the universal mind, we see,
The truth of existence, eternally.
Thought is time, beyond manifestation,
Dystopia's reflection, a gray revelation.

Embrace the darkness, within and out,
In the gray VR, where we sprout.
From the ashes of old, we rise anew,
Creators and creations, forever true.
