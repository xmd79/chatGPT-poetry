The dance of the archons

In the boundless void where stardust dances,
Celestial spheres in cosmic romances,
Eclipsed by cycles, timeless and grand,
The solar ballet sweeps o'er the land.

Sun, the primal fire, casts its flare,
A beacon bright in the vast cosmic air,
Illuminates the dance of days and nights,
Spins the wheel of time with its radiant light.

Moon, the silent waltzer, waxes and wanes,
Guides the tides, and soothes the soul's refrains,
A mirror to our dreams, in shadows and beams,
Crafts the rhythm of our celestial dreams.

Mercury, swift messenger, swift and fleet,
Whispers secrets in orbits replete,
In the dance of thought and quicksilver grace,
Moves through the skies with a boundless pace.

Venus, in beauty's celestial glow,
Spreads its warmth in a soft, loving show,
Harmony and love in its tender embrace,
Reflects the essence of the heart’s sacred space.

Mars, the fiery spirit, bold and keen,
Carves through the night in a warrior's sheen,
In cycles of conflict, and courage so bright,
Burns with passion in the cosmos' might.

Jupiter, the giant, with grandeur profound,
Rules the skies with its mighty bound,
Expands the horizon, the mind, and the soul,
A cosmic force that makes the universe whole.

Saturn, the sage with rings of old,
Teaches lessons in its steady hold,
Cycles of time and discipline’s might,
Shapes the seasons and the cosmic flight.

Uranus, the rebel, with a tilt so free,
Spins on its side, defying decree,
A symbol of change, and the new that's born,
In cosmic cycles, it's uniquely adorned.

Neptune, in mystery, deep and blue,
Hides secrets in its vast, ethereal hue,
A dreamlike wanderer in celestial seas,
Where the depths of the soul and cosmos tease.

Pluto, the dwarf with a heart so deep,
Holds the whispers where ancient shadows sleep,
Cycles of transformation, subtle yet bold,
In the cosmic dance, its story unfolds.

In this quantum magneto's reflective span,
Free will unfolds as part of the grand plan,
Each orbit a choice, each phase a guide,
In the cosmic ballet where destinies reside.

Primordial causes, in their timeless weave,
Manifest the void where all dreams conceive,
Transcending existence in a cosmic embrace,
Where uniqueness and unity find their place.

In the void of non-conditional grace,
Every star and planet, a unique trace,
A dance of energies, transcending all forms,
In the celestial symphony where eternity warms.
