The Tengu's Gift: A Poetic Journey Through Akashic Fields, Virtues, and the 5th Dimension

In realms unseen, where mysteries reside,
A tengu's gaze, with secrets wide.
Through Akashic depths, their wisdom gleams,
A symphony of virtues, in cosmic dreams.

From zero point, where gravity's embrace,
Vortex math weaves, in cosmic space.
Sacred geometry, in patterns grand,
Infinity unfolds, in cosmic strand.

Stationarity and waves, in perfect dance,
Fields of energy, in cosmic expanse.
Frequencies align, in bands so bright,
Transcendence beckons, in cosmic light.

Circle's essence, with dot as core,
Trinity's embrace, a harmony of lore.
Square's stability, a firm embrace,
Hexagon's rhythm, a cosmic space.

Elements intertwine, in patterns true,
One to nine, their essence accrue.
One, the source, from which all springs,
Two, the duality, where balance swings.

Three, the trinity, of spirit, mind, and soul,
Four, the foundation, on which all is whole.
Five, the human form, in earthly guise,
Six, the union of opposites, in cosmic ties.

Seven, the gateway, to higher realms,
Eight, the infinity, that never ends.
Nine, the completion, of cosmic space,
Ten, the return, to the starting place.

Tengu crows, they guide our quest,
To unlock the secrets, that lie in our chest.
Through Akashic fields, and tengu's lore,
We'll find the virtues, that forevermore.

Wisdom, compassion, courage, balance, and grace,
The Tengu's gift, in this cosmic space.
So let us soar, with tengu's grace,
And embrace the virtues, in this sacred space.
