The Hermetic Connection Observers, Objects, and the Universe

In the world beyond what we can see,
There lies an occult reality,
Where the observer and the observed are one,
And the universe is a cosmic run.

Through the lens of Hermetic principles,
We see the microcosm in the macro's ripple,
As above, so below, the ancients taught,
The inner and outer worlds are but a single thought.

And in this cosmic dance of give and take,
The observer and the observed both partake,
As objects around us reflect our inner truth,
And the universe responds to our every move.

Through the power of the mind and will,
We shape the universe with every thrill,
As our thoughts and emotions ripple out,
And the universe responds, without a doubt.

So let us remember the occult connection,
Between the observer and the universe's reflection,
And embrace the power of the Hermetic laws,
To shape our reality and fulfill our cosmic cause.

For in the micro and macro, we find,
The power to shape our lives and minds,
And through the wisdom of the Hermetic way,
We can unlock the secrets of the universe each day.
