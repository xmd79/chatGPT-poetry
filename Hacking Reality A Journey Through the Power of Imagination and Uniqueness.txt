Hacking Reality: A Journey Through Self-Awareness, Imagination, and Uniqueness

In the realm of the unseen, the archons dwell,
Masters of deception, weaving spells,
Their influence felt in the depths of the mind,
Where thoughts and emotions are intertwined.

Through mental projection, they seek to control,
The thoughts and feelings of the human soul,
Leading us astray with their subtle lies,
And clouding our vision with their dark disguise.

They whisper in our ears and plant their seeds,
Of doubt and fear, of hatred and greed,
And in our hearts, their darkness takes hold,
As we wander through life, in a story untold.
