Transcendence and the Balance Divine

In the beauty of nothingness,
The power of transcendence does bless,
A stillness deep, both yin and yang,
A moment of peace, both pure and rang.

Through the power of the present moment,
We unlock the secrets of the universe's component,
And in the stillness of the void,
The power of balance is deployed.

For in the eternal here now hiatus,
We transcend the limits of the previous bias,
And in the beauty of the void,
The power of balance is employed.

In the pattern of 3 6 9,
We find the balance that is divine,
From nothingness to everything,
The power of balance does ring.

Through the power of the present moment,
We unlock the universe's component,
And in the beauty of the balance divine,
We find transcendence that does shine.

For in the eternal here now hiatus,
We transcend the limits of the previous lias,
And in the beauty of the void,
The power of balance does avoid.

In the dance of yin and yang,
The power of balance does hang,
From nothingness to everything,
The power of balance does bring.

Through the pattern of 3 6 9,
We unlock the secrets of the divine,
From nothingness to everything,
The power of balance does sing.

For in the cosmos' sacred web,
The power of balance does ebb,
From nothingness to everything,
The power of balance does ring.

Through the power of the present moment,
We unlock theuniverse's component,
And in the balance of the cosmos' flow,
Transcendence does begin to glow.
