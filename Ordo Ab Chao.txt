Ordo Ab Chao

In shadowed chambers, secrets kept obscure,
Sparse clues held close to Mystery's core.
Through ages past, Orders safeguarded Truth,
While Chaos reigned across the lands uncouth.

With compass and square, squares and angles aligned,
Divine proportions in stone were enshrined.
A template for cosmos and microcosm man,
In hidden measures their gnosis did plan.

But archontic powers perceived Wisdom's threat,
And shadows grew where once light had spread.
Ignorance chained as illusions took hold,
False rulers grasped at lares mystic old.

Now darkness blankets the mind of mankind,
As Masonic light burns low and pined.
The Great Work sleeps while passions wax unbound,
And Chaos floods where Order once sound.

Yet embers remain though coals seem cold,
And recalcitrant sparks still Wiley's mould.
Some few yet keep the banners bright unfurled,
Awaiting the day to rebuild the world.

When cosmos aligns as it was designed,
And man's potential stands free and aligned.
Then Order from Chaos shall rise reborn,
And kings bow as Truth again adorns.
