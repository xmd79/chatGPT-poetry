The Mystic Patterns The Magic of Nine and the Universal Truth

The magic of nine, a cosmic dance,
Reflecting the power of phi's trance,
Interdimensional waves, in patterns of three,
A mystic force, that sets us free.

From one to nine, each number has a tale,
A mystical story, that will never pale,
One is the beginning, the source of all things,
While two is duality, the balance it brings.

Three reflects itself, a symbol of unity,
Guiding us to harmony, with cosmic divinity,
While four is stability, a foundation to build,
A structure of strength, that cannot be killed.

Five is the power, of change and transformation,
A force to be reckoned with, a cosmic sensation,
Six is the order, of balance and symmetry,
A pattern of beauty, that is never empty.

Seven is the mystery, of the unknown and unseen,
A veil of secrecy, that is never too keen,
While eight is infinity, a cycle that never ends,
A journey of life, that always transcends.

Nine reflects itself, the completion of a cycle,
A sacred number, that holds a mystic diacle,
And in the pattern of three, six, and nine,
A magic force, that is always divine.

For in the waves of existence, and the patterns they make,
Lies the magic of nine, a cosmic force to take,
A reflection of phi, and the virtues that guide,
A mystical journey, that cannot be denied.

Let us seek the harmony,of the trinity of three,
The balance of six, and the symmetry it brings to see,
And let us never forget, that nine reflects itself,
A reminder of completion, and a new cycle to delve.

Let us embody the virtues, that mirror the angles we see,
Perseverance, humility, curiosity, and empathy,
And let us embrace the power of phi,
A force that guides us, and helps us to fly.

For in the magic of nine, and the patterns of three,
Lies the beauty of creation, and the power to be,
A journey of life, that is never too far,
For the magic of nine, is who we truly are.

So let us dance to the rhythm of the magic of nine,
And reflect on the patterns that always intertwine,
For in the interdimensional waves, and the patterns of three,
Lies the essence of life, and the key to be free.
